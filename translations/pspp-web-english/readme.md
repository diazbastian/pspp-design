# Template for translation for PSPP website

If you have a good command of their native language and English, can help create a new translation for the PSPP website.

Below are a number of templates that correspond to sections of the PSPP website. These templates are in the original English language, and written with [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

* [Home](https://github.com/bedf/PSPP-document-translations/blob/master/pspp-web-english/home_page.md)
* [Get PSPP](https://github.com/bedf/PSPP-document-translations/blob/master/pspp-web-english/get_pspp.md)
* [Contribute](https://github.com/bedf/PSPP-document-translations/blob/master/pspp-web-english/contribute.md)
* [FAQ](https://github.com/bedf/PSPP-document-translations/blob/master/pspp-web-english/FAQ.md)
* [Quick tour](https://github.com/bedf/PSPP-document-translations/blob/master/pspp-web-english/quick_tour.md)
* [Documentation](https://github.com/bedf/PSPP-document-translations/blob/master/pspp-texinfo-english/readme.md)

In case you do not know the markdown syntax, simply copy the templates and translate paragraphs and sentences holding the preset markup.

I encourage you to contribute. The translation will take some of your time and will make PSPP, more inclusive software.

Include name (or nickname) and email contact. (to communicate changes to the original Web and coordinate changes)
